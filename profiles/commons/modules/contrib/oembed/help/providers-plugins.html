<p>oEmbed Providers plugin data:</p>

<pre>
'title' => 'Default provider',
'description' => 'oEmbed provider for remote endpoints',

'scheme callback' => The scheme callback returns an array of regular expressions keyed by
child plugin name. The scheme callback is called when the plugin is processed by ctools to
assemble a regular expression of URLs that can be fulfilled by that plugin.

'get child' => The singular 'get child' callback should be used to limit the number of
plugin definitions that are loaded and cached.

'capture subpatterns' => Local providers extract arguments from the URL. When converting
the plugin's schemes to regular expressions, the capture subpatterns determines whether
the $matches array passed around in the request process contains multiple values.

'callback' => Params ($plugin, $url, $matches, $parameters) This callback should return
an array that is an oEmbed response for the $url and $parameters. If the provider is
not local, $plugin contains endpoint details. If the provider is local, $matches contains
arguments from the URL.

'provider' => Boolean to indicate that this plugin is used as an oEmbed provider. Plugins
that integrate with the oEmbed endpoint so that Drupal content can have an embeddable
representation available to third party sites are most likely provider plugins.
'consumer' => Boolean to indicate that this plugin is used as an oEmbed consumer. Plugins
that integrate with third party sites are most likely consumer plugins.

// If a plugin doesn't indicate TRUE for provider or consumer, it is effectively disabled
// and will never be used. Plugins may set both 'provider' and 'consumer' to TRUE.
