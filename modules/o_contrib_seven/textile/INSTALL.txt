Installation
------------
Install the Textile module as you would with any Drupal module.

Before enabling the module, you must place the Textile PHP class in your Drupal
installation. See External Dependencies below for details.

After enabling the module, you must add the Textile filter to the appropriate
input formats and set any desired configuration options.

NOTE: You need to be careful with the order of your input filters. It is
recommended to set up a special filter for textile, disable the line-break
converter, set up the HTML filter to run AFTER textile, and only allow the types
of tags you want to permit.


External dependencies
---------------------
This module depends on the Variables API module [1]; install it before the
Textile module.

This module depends also on the Textile PHP class from the
TextPattern project [2]. The classTextile.php is packaged in the
source/textpattern/lib directory of that project. This file must be downloaded
and placed inside the include directory present in the directory containing the
module, or alternatively managed as an external library via the Variables API
module (see the optional "Libraries configuration" below).

You may download the most recent TextPattern tarball from [2] and extract the
classTextile.php file.

The file may also be obtained directly from the subversion (svn) repository
using wget/curl, svn export or svn externals. The most recent stable version can
be found by browsing the Google code repository [3].

  * Navigate to the most recent version (4.3.0 at the time of writing).
  * Navigate to the source/textpattern/lib directory.
  * Download the classTextile.ph*p file (eg, right click, save as) or copy the
    URL of the file and use wget/curl, svn export, or svn externals to obtain
    the file from via the command line.

If you are maintaing your code base in svn you may use svn export which writes a
copy to your local directory without the .svn hidden files to track changes. Run
the following commands from within the "include" directory inside the Textile
module's installation directory:

svn export http://textpattern.googlecode.com/svn/releases/4.3.0/source/textpattern/lib/classTextile.php

Alternatively, instead of checking out, externals may be used. Externals can be
seen as (remote) symlinks in subversion, and requires your own project in your
own svn repository, of course. Since externals do not work well on a single
file, you must use the Textile library approach as indicated in the optional
Libraries Configuration (detailed below). Use the following commands:

cd sites/all/libraries
svn propedit svn:externals .

Your editor will open. Add a line:

textile http://textpattern.googlecode.com/svn/releases/4.3.0/source/textpattern/lib/

Using this method, future checkouts and code updates of your project repository
will force svn to grab the externals, but it will keep the references on the
remote server.


Libraries configuration (optional)
----------------------------------
From version 7.x-2.0-rc8 and onward, this module supports placing the Textile
class in a separate shared location within your Drupal installation, and uses
the Variables API module for dynamically finding the external code libraries
(such as Textile).

To create a library for Textile, create a directory called 'textile' in one of
the recommended locations for shared libraries. The locations where the
'textile' directory is searched are:

  * sites/all/libraries/textile
  * sites/$domain/libraries/textile
  * profiles/$profile/libraries/textile

$domain is the domain name, and $profile is the currently used profile name.
