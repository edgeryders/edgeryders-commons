<p>File Conveyor mode uses the <a href="http://fileconveyor.org" target="_blank">File Conveyor</a> daemon to synchronize files and can be used with both Origin Pull and Push CDNs. If you're using an Origin Pull CDN and want to optimize files before they're synced to the CDN, it is also recommended to use this mode.</p>

<p>Note that this requires a fair amount of server administration knowledge. It is powerful, but that power comes with the price of a more complex configuration.</p>
