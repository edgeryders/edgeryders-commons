<p>After a file has been synced, File Conveyor stores the "absolute file path" to "URL of the file on the CDN" mapping in a SQLite database. The CDN module then uses this database to replace file URLs with their corresponding CDN URLs.</p>

<p>This file usually lives in the same directory as File Conveyor itself. By default, it's called <tt>synced_files.db</tt>.</p>
