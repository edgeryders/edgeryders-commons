<p>It is essential that you understand the <a href="http://wimleers.com/article/key-properties-of-a-cdn">key properties of a CDN</a>, most importantly the differences between an <em>Origin Pull CDN</em> and a <em>Push CDN</em>. If you understand that, continue to make a choice between the two supported modes:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Origin Pull mode</strong> replaces your domain name with the Origin Pull CDN's domain name in the file URL.</li>
<li><strong>File Conveyor mode</strong> uses the <a href="http://fileconveyor.org" target="_blank">File Conveyor</a> daemon to synchronize files and can be used with both Origin Pull and Push CDNs. If you're using an Origin Pull CDN and want to optimize files before they're synced to the CDN, it is also recommended to use this mode.</li>
</ul>
