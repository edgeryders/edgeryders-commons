Content Experiments
====================

This module allows a Drupal site administrator to create Google Content Experiments within
a Drupal site. It is in its infancy. What this means is that it does what is to be expected,
but that the user interface is extremely minimal and is limited.

In short, this module allows users to insert Google Content Experiments IDs into their
sites, which generate valid Google Content Experiments JavaScript in the header of the
pages in the appropriate place. A user should simply paste the Experiment ID provided by
Google Content Experiments into the box on the node edit form for the node consisting of
the control page.

Once the module is enabled, the user can navigate to the node edit form for any existing
node or for any new node the user wishes to create, and scroll to the bottom and paste
Content Experimemnts code in the Content Experiments tab, which should appear above the
"Publishing Options" tab.

This module is destined for numerous improvements, but what it does do, at the time of this
writing, is fill a gaping need for Drupal users who want to do A/B testing with Google
Content Experiments.
