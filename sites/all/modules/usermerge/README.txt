## Caution
This module tells you which features will be migrated on the form page.  If you use another module that has user related data (private messages, twitter, meez, flag friend, flag users, etc?) those may not be migrated.  Take a look at the sample hook implementations to see how to use this module.

* Provide better support for profiles.
* Provide an option to block or delete the account when done.
* Provide a "self-service" method that asks for the username/password of the account to delete.
* Provide a confirmation page with the number of items that will be merged.
